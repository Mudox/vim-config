# MY Neovim's Configuration

![snapshot](https://github.com/mudox/vim-config/raw/master/snapshots/1.png)

Since I started learning & using Vim/Neovim 3 years ago, my configuration has grown to be

- have 4K+ lines of configuring code managed & distributed in 160+ small files,
- a configuration manager plugin written by myself (but not published yet)
- several other plugins I written (but not plublished yet)
- 160+ plugins for various situations

Currently it is not portable (out of box), due to

- Neovim's key features & artchitecture are not stable
- My lack of repo maintaining experience & energy
