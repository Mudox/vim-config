# MY NeoVim's Configuration
======

[snapshot](https://github.com/mudox/vim-config/raw/master/snapshots/1.png)

Since I started learning & using Vim/NeoVim 3 years ago, my configuration has grown to be

- have 4K+ lines of configuring code managed & distributed in 160+ small files,
- a configuration mamager plugin written by myself (but not published)
- several other plugins I written (but not plublished)
- 160+ plugins for verious situations

currently it is not portable, due to

- NeoVim's key features & artchitecture are not stable
- I lack of repo maintaining experience & energy
